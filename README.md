# Opensource Rotordynamics Analysis Tool (ORATool)

ORATool is a open source Rotordynamics analysis tool which allows engineers, researcher to perform the dynamics analysis in the field of rotating machine.

This tool provide the basic function to perform classical rotordynamic analysis as below:
*

*

In the same time, the extenability of ORATool allows the users to develop his own features in order to consider coupled phenomenes in rotordynamics. 


This opensource Rotordynamics code is initialized by Dr Silun.ZHANG.
